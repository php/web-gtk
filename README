Editor files
We will use the bluefish editor.
1) Because it is licensed under the GNU_GPL. There will be no cost with the purchase of paid editors.
2) We will avoid possible dirt in the generated code for various file editors.
3) Supports multiple encoding which will facilitate the creation of files in different languages.

text=Be aware of these conventions, even if you choose to ignore them.께When you write here, it is a common practice to use the second or third person. Remember '''Dragnet''' and write "Just the facts, ma'am." Give concrete advice.께When you ''do'' write in the first person, it is conventional to sign your work. To sign a section of a page, follow it with your name made into a WikiWord.께Some wikis prefer all signatures to go in a separate WikiGroup. If you are unsure, see what others have done.께People often use the first person to describe their own experiences.께It is conventional not to change a paragraph that someone else has signed, except to correct obvious mistakes. So if you'd prefer that something you write not be changed, sign it.께Unsigned work is considered open for change. So if you want to, go ahead and change it.께Practice understatement. Use plain language. Be bold and be nice.

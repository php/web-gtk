text=Page''''History displays a summary of past edits on a page. Each past edit is shown in a box which shows lines added, changed or deleted during that edit in a before & after format.께Below each box is a "Restore" link. Clicking the link will open an edit box with the page as it was ''before'' that edit.  You can make changes or simply click Save to restore the text.께There are two additional options specific to Page''''History:* '''Hide minor edits''' - hides any edit that the author marked as 'minor'.* '''Show changes to markup'''- shows changes to the markup (as opposed to the normal display which shows changes to the output).께A page's history is kept for the number of days given by the $DiffKeepDays variable (set by the site's WikiAdministrator).  When a page is edited, any page history information older than this value is automatically discarded.께%trail% <<|PmWiki.DocumentationIndex|>>

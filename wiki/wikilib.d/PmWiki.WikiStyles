text=WikiStyles allow an author to modify the color and other attributes of text that follow.  A style specification such as @@[=%red%=]@@ will cause the following text to be displayed as red until the end of the line or the next pair of percent signs.  For example:께   [=%red%=] This text is red and [=%blue%=] this text is blue [=%%=] but    this text is normal.께gives께->%red% This text is red and %blue% this text is blue %% but this text is normal.께The set of {{predefined wiki styles}} is customizable by the WikiAdministrator.  Most PmWiki systems define [=%newwin%=] to cause links to open in a new window (%newwin%[[WikiStyles example]]), and standard text colors such as [=%black%, %white%, %red%, %green%, %blue%, etc.=]께!!Creating new styles께Placing @@color@@, @@bgcolor@@, or @@target@@ specifications inside of a pair of percent signs will change the style of the following text to use those colors up to the end of a line or until the next pair of percent-signs.  For example:께    [=%color=red% This text is red and %color=blue% this text     is blue %% but this text is normal. =]께renders as께->%color=red% This text is red and %color=blue% this text is blue %% but this text is normal.께One can also change the background color using the @@bgcolor@@ attribute:께    [=%color=white bgcolor=green% This text is white on green %color=green% and    this is green on white. =]께->%color=white bgcolor=green% This text is white on green %color=green% and this is green on white.께One can specify that links should open in a new window via the @@target@@ attribute:께    [=%target=_blank% Any links on this line like http://www.pmichaud.com     will open in a new window. =]께which gives께->%target=_blank% Any links on this line like http://www.pmichaud.com will open in a new window.께Finally, WikiStyles can control the width and height of ImagesInWikiPages, thus the markup께    [=%height=50% http://www.example.com/some.gif=]께will display some.gif scaled to a height of 50 pixels.께!!Style definitions%define=hotpink color=#ff69b4%%define=reverse color=white bgcolor=black%께Wiki authors can also make their own {{WikiStyle|s}} definitions within a document using the @@define@@ attribute.  For example, the statement께    [=%define=hotpink color=#ff69b4%=]께will cause the markup @@[=%hotpink%=]@@ to be a shortcut for @@[=%color=#ff69b4%=]@@ (%hotpink%like this%%).  One can specify multiple items in a definition, as in께    [=%define=reverse color=white bgcolor=black%=]께which allows @@[=%reverse%=]@@ to cause %reverse%reverse video%%, and @@[=%reverse hotpink%=]@@ to be the %reverse hotpink%combination of both shortcuts%%.  께It's often a good idea to put common style definitions into GroupHeaders so that they can be shared among multiple pages in a group.  Or, the WikiAdministrator can predefine styles as a {{LocalCustomization|s}} -- see WikiStylesAdmin.께!!Predefined styles께See {{predefined wiki styles}} for a description of the WikiStyles that are defined in a standard installation of PmWiki. That page also describes how an administrator can predefine additional WikiStyles.께!!Colors콵or some examples of colors, see WikiStyleColors께%trail% <<|PmWiki.DocumentationIndex|>>께

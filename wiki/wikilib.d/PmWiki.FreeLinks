text=A {{free link|s}} is a page name reference that doesn't follow the WikiWord convention.께Often, there is no natural WikiWord for naming a page. That's when @@[={{free links}}=]@@ (a page called {{free links}}) are useful. The @@[={{text}}=]@@ markup creates a link to a page called '''Text'''. The @@[={{longer form}}=]@@ markup creates a link to a page called '''[=LongerForm=]''' and displays as ''longer form''.께Other examples include:* hyphenated words, like @@[={{post-modern music}}=]@@* plurals, like @@[={{wiki group}}s=]@@ which produces {{wiki group}}s* plurals of @@[={{WikiWord}}s=]@@ which produces {{WikiWord}}s* ending truncation, such as @@[={{install|ation}}=]@@ which displays as {{install|ation}}* alternate endings with the '''|''' markup, as in @@[={{install|ation}}ed=]@@ which produces a link to a page called '''Installation''' and renders on screen as {{install|ation}}ed* pages in other groups, like @@[=Main/{{home page}}=]@@ or @@[={{Main/home page}}=]@@ which produce Main/{{home page}}.* pages starting with the '''~''' character, as in [@{{~Pm}}@] which produces a link to the appropriate page in the Profiles group: {{~Pm}}께A {{free link|s}} must start with a letter (upper or lower case) and end with a letter (upper or lower case) or a number. A word can contain any combination of letters and hyphens, but not two adjacent hyphens. Words can be separated by one or more spaces, each word is then capitalized and the spaces are removed (or converted to underscores depending on site configuration).께The name of the page is always in Title Case. This means some pages may have multiple names. For example @@[=FreeLinks=]@@ and @@[={{free links}}=]@@ are both references to FreeLinks.께{{Free links}} can be used in combination with @@[=[[{{free links}} alternate text]]=]@@. This produces  [[{{free links}} alternate text]]. The administrator can configure non-existent {{free links}} to display as (alternate text)? for greater clarity. 께<<|PmWiki.DocumentationIndex|>>께

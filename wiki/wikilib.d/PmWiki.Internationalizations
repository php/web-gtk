text=PmWiki supports internationalization of web pages, allowing accented characters to appear in page names and almost complete customization of PmWiki's prompts.  Most customization is provided via the [=XLPage()=] function in PmWiki, which loads a set of translation variables from a wiki page (typically named [=XLPage=], but it can be named anything you wish).께!!!Loading translation pages께Pages for many languages such as French, German, Dutch, and Spanish have already been created and maintained at the pmichaud.com site.  You can download an archive of these translations from http://www.pmichaud.com/pub/pmwiki/i18n.tgz.  Simply unpack the archive into the directory containing your ''pmwiki.php'' installation.  The archive contains a number of page files that are placed in your wikilib.d/ directory, and some special scripts for translations that use a character set other than iso-8859-1 (PmWiki's default).께Once the translation pages are installed, you enable a language by adding a call to [=XLPage()=] in your ''config.php'' file.  For example, to select French language prompts, one would specify께    [=XLPage('fr','PmWikiFr.XLPage');=]께which says to load the translations for French ('fr') from the page PmWikiFr.XLPage.  It's perfectly okay to load multiple pages; so if you want to create your own local translations without changing the ones you got from ''i18n.tgz'', just create another page (see below) and load it on top:    [=    XLPage('fr','PmWikiFr.XLPage');       # from i18n.tgz    XLPage('fr','PmWikiFr.XLPageLocal');  # my local translations    =]께!!!Creating new translations께If language pages don't exist for your desired language, it's easy to create one!  An [=XLPage=] translation file simply contains lines of the form께   'phrase' => 'translated phrase',께where "phrase" is an internationalized phrase (denoted by @@$[...]@@) in PmWiki's $...Fmt {{variables}}, and "translated phrase" is what should be printed in your particular language.  For example, the line (in [=PmWikiDe.XLPage=])께   [='SearchWiki' => 'Suchen',=]께converts [="SearchWiki"=] to "Suchen" on output.  The file PmWiki:XLPageTemplate is a good starting point for creating a new [=XLPage=] and has most of PmWiki's key phrases already listed in it.  Note that the translation mechanism only converts phrases that have been listed as translatable in $...Fmt strings--it won't translate things that appear in wiki markup.께If you create new versions of PmWiki pages in other languages, please consider adding them to the [[PmWiki:PmWiki main PmWiki site]] so that they can be made available to others in the ''i18n.tgz'' archive!께->%note% The term "i18n" is commonly used as an abbreviation for the English word "internationalization".  The abbreviation is derived from the fact that there are 18 letters between the "i" and the final "n" and few people want to type them all out. 께%trail% <<|PmWiki.DocumentationIndex|>>

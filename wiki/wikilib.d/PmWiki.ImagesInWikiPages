text=To place an image inside a wiki page, simply enter the address (URL) of the image you want to include.  For example, the URL @@[=http://www.pmichaud.com/toast/ptart-1c.gif=]@@ displays in the text as께http://www.pmichaud.com/toast/ptart-1c.gif께All [=URLs=] ending in .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, and .png are automatically treated as image placeholders in PmWiki.  The position of the image URL in a line determines how it will display in the page:* an image URL at the beginning of a line displays the image at the left margin with text wrapped to the right* an image URL at the end of a line displays the image at the right margin with text wrapped to the left* an image URL in the middle of a line displays the image in line with the text* an image URL on a line by itself is displayed by itself께The special markup @@[=[[<<]]=]@@ can be used to tell PmWiki to skip to a point below any floating images.께Images must be stored on a webserver somewhere in order to be displayed in PmWiki.  If the system has been configured to enable {{uploads}}, then you can upload an image as a page attachment and include it using the @@[=Attach:=]@@ markup.  Otherwise, HowToUploadImages describes the process of uploading images to a webserver.께Images may be specified as the target of a link using the double brackets markup by specifying an image URL as the text for a link (see LinksToExternalPages).  For example, the image to the right of this paragraph is a link to the Strawberry Pop-Tart Blow-Torches page produced by this markup :[[<<]]@@[=[[http://www.pmichaud.com/toast http://www.pmichaud.com/toast/ptart-1c.gif]]=]@@[[http://www.pmichaud.com/toast http://www.pmichaud.com/toast/ptart-1c.gif]] [[<<]]께You can also use WikiStyles to scale the image to a different width and/or height; for example, to scale an image to 40 pixels high you can add @@[=%height=40%=]@@ in front of the image URL and @@[=%%=]@@ after the URL.  Note that the scaling is performed within the browser, thus transfer times are not reduced.  께The following is an example of an image scaled and at the same time the target of the link: [=%height=60%[[http://www.pmichaud.com/toast http://www.pmichaud.com/toast/toast-4a.gif]]%%=]%height=60%[[http://www.pmichaud.com/toast http://www.pmichaud.com/toast/toast-4a.gif]]%%[[<<]]께This works equally with [[{{PmWiki/Uploads}} Attach]] when enabled. [=%height=10%Attach:pmwiki-40.gif%%=]께%trail%<<|PmWiki.DocumentationIndex|>>

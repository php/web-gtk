text=Here are some quick instructions on how to download and install PmWiki.  Improvements to these instructions would be greatly appreciated. If you encounter problems during installation process take a look at TroubleShooting.께-> %note% Windows/IIS users may wish to take a look at InstallationWin32 for more help with installation.께1. Download the [[http://www.pmwiki.org/pub/pmwiki/pmwiki-latest.tgz latest]] version of PmWiki from http://www.pmwiki.org/pub/pmwiki/.께2. Extract the tar image using "@@tar xvfz pmwiki.tgz@@" (note that the tar file has to be extracted with the proper permissions set... see the note at the end of this page for more.).  This will create a @@pmwiki-x.y.z@@ directory which contains the PmWiki software.  Rename this directory to "pmwiki" by executing "@@mv pmwiki-x.y.z pmwiki@@" . The files in this directory include께    COPYING            The GNU General Public License    README             A small intro file    local/             A directory for local configuration scripts    pmwiki.php         Main PmWiki script    pub/               Directory of publicly accessible files      css/             Directory for generic .css files      skins/           Directory of [[LayoutBasics layout templates]]    sample-config.php  A sample configuration file    scripts/           Some scripts that extend the possibilities of PmWiki    wikilib.d/         Directory containing some default PmWiki files          쾆hese files need to be placed where they can be accessed by a web server (e.g. in a ''public_html'' directory of some sort).  께3. Temporarily change the permissions on the directory containing @@pmwiki.php@@ directory to 2777.  In Unix this is normally done by changing to the directory containing @@pmwiki.php@@ and executing "@@chmod 2777 .@@" (note the dot at the end).  This will (1) make the directory writable so the web server can create the data directory it needs for the wiki files, and (2) preserve group ownership of the directory so the installer account can manipulate the files created in this directory.께->%note% Note for Windows IIS installations:  You may have to provide IUSR_ write permission on the wiki directory.  Note that IUSR_ is ''not'' part of 'Everyone'.께->%note% If your FTP client does not allow you to set permissions to 2777, perhaps have a look at [=SmartFTP=] (http://www.smartftp.com) which allows you to do so.께->%note% If you use PmWiki with SSL you have to adjust the variable @@[=ScriptUrl=]@@ in @@pmwiki.php@@: change 'http' to 'https'.께4. If you're running Apache version 2.0.30 or later, you may need to set the [=AcceptPathInfo=] directive to "on" for the @@pmwiki.php@@ script.  This can be as simple as adding    [=AcceptPathInfo on=]쾢o either the @@.htaccess@@ file in the directory containing @@pmwiki.php@@ or the server's @@httpd.conf@@ file.  If changing the @@httpd.conf@@ file, don't forget to restart Apache to have the change take effect.께For more on this issue, see AcceptPathInfo.께5. Open a web browser to the @@pmwiki.php@@ script.  When @@pmwiki.php@@ is first executed, it creates the @@wiki.d@@ directory for holding wiki pages with appropriate ownership and permissions.  Once @@wiki.d@@ has been created, the  directory permissions can be set back to 755 or whatever you prefer to use (e.g., execute "@@chmod 755 .@@").께6. Installations of PmWiki onto Microsoft Windows platforms will want to look at PmWiki:WinDiff for additional packages to be loaded to enable Page History functionality. If your provider has put you in [[PhpSafeMode safe mode]], you can use Cookbook:PHPDiffEngine to enable Page History.께7.  Check out InitialSetupTasks for other tasks you may want to perform to begin customizing your PmWiki installation.  You might also want to peruse the ReleaseNotes for further information.께('''Note:''' It is important that the tar file (@@*.tar@@) is unpacked with the proper permissions set.  For *nix operating systems, please check your permission mask by typing @@umask@@ at the command-line.  If it says anything other than "2", you'll need to change the permission mask by typing @@umask 002@@ at the command-line.  ''Then'' unpack the tar file.  If you do not do this the @@pmwiki.php@@ script will not be able to make use of other files in the tree.)께----께%trail%<<|PmWiki.DocumentationIndex|>>

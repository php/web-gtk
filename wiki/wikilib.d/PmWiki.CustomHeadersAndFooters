text=This page describes how you can change the default headers and footers that appear on PmWiki pages.  Setting the headers and footers is usually done by changing the value of {{variables}} in the ''config.php'' file (described in InitialSetupTasks and LocalCustomizations).께-> %note% Note: This page describes the customization options that were used for version 0.5.  While the notes below are still correct for version 0.6, version 0.6 provides a more advanced layout mechanism based on stylesheets.  See LayoutBasics for more details.께The appearance of a page in PmWiki is controlled by the $PageHeaderFmt and $PageFooterFmt variables.  $PageHeaderFmt specifies the HTML markup to be output after the HTML <body> tag but before the contents of the wiki page itself.  $PageFooterFmt specifies the HTML markup after the contents of the wiki page but before the closing </body> tag.  To change the page layout to contain only a simple title at the top and an "Edit Page" link at the bottom, one could do (in ''config.php''):께    $PageHeaderFmt = '<h1>$Title</h1><hr />';    $PageFooterFmt = '<hr /><small><a href="$PageUrl?action=edit">Edit      Page</a></small>';께Both of these variables (and most PmWiki variables ending in 'Fmt') are processed for global $-variable substitutions prior to being output.  Thus,  @@$Title@@ and @@$PageUrl@@ in the above statements will be replaced with the title of the page and the URL of the page when the values are output.께$PageHeaderFmt and $PageFooterFmt also allow the HTML output to come from a file on disk, an administrator-defined PHP function, or another wiki page.  For example, one can create a file called ''local/myheader.html'' with the markup for the HTML page header, and then include the contents of that file as the header by specifying께    $PageHeaderFmt = [='file:local/myheader.html'=];께Other examples include:    [=    # include a php file    $PageHeaderFmt = 'file:local/myheader.php';        # a user-defined function    $PageHeaderFmt = 'function:MyHeaderFunction';      # a per-group PageHeader wiki page     $PageHeaderFmt = 'wiki:$Group.PageHeader'; =]     께Finally, any of these variables can be arrays of values to be output, allowing combinations of the above.  For example    [=    $PageHeaderFmt = array(      '<h1>$Group.$Title</h1><table><tr><td width="20%">',      'wiki:$Group.LeftMenu',      '</td><td>');    $PageFooterFmt = '</td></table>';=]께will display a page with the group name and title at the top, followed by a two-cell HTML table with the contents of the [=LeftMenu=] page in the left cell and the contents of the wiki page in the right cell.께See PageLayout for more details about the organization and structure of pages produced by PmWiki.께%trail%<<|PmWiki.DocumentationIndex|>>
